# Write-up Template

## Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*
  
#### Based on the relative simplicity of the CMS project, I decided to create the app using App Service instead of a VM. This decision is due to the fact that the CMSâ€™s simplicity does not require the enhanced access and control that a VM offers. The App Service is sufficient for our needs. Additionally, it is not only relatively cheaper to use App Service, but it is also easier and faster to set up compared to a VM.

## Assess app changes that would change your decision.

#### If the CMS app would be needing better performance, higher memory needs, and better security, then I would personally be changing to a VM.
